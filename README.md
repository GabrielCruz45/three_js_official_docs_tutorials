# THREE.JS BASICS/FUNDAMENTALS TUTORIALS

<https://threejs.org/manual/#en/fundamentals>
    This repository contains all the files and scripts made whilst completing the aforementioned text tutorials on three.js

Also, used Gemini (Google's LLM) to create various drills in order to solidfy the concepts, methods, patterns etc.
The folders made with the intention of completing these drills will have a DRILL.md file detaling each exercise.
