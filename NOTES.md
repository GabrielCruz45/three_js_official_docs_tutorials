# COURSE NOTES

The fundamentals of 3D rendering
    1. Geometries -> Shape
    2. Materials -> Look and feel
    3. Meshes -> is a shell or boundary model that defines the object's surface, not its internal volume

What is a shader?  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mfvZ-mdtZQ>
    A small, specialized program that runs entirely on your GPU to calculate the final appearance of graphics.

What is the rendering pipeline? <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qUuzRY5YwI>
    Is the conceptual model that dictates the sequence of stpes of graphics system,
    primarily the GPU, must execute to convert a 3D scene's data (models, lights, camera)
    into a final 2D image on your screen.
    Generally divided into three major stages: Application, Geometry and Rasterization
